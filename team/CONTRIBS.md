### Launch Screen
- Implemented the launch screen on start-up 
- This displays the application's name while the app is loading

### Profile Page
- I implemented the profile page for the current user
- This helps the user see his/her profile information

### Update Profile
- In conjunction with the profile page I added a view that allows the user to update their profile
- This is a separate view and it updates the user's information in the database

### Retrieving Profiles
- After connecting with the database the user is now able to retrieve other users information
- This helped with allowing users to see other profiles

### Matching Users
- Implemented the logic that allows users to match with other users
- When a match occurs the user is notified immediately with a message that is displayed
- Also, with this I implemented liking others users

# Introduction

Roomi is a mobile application that allows users to find and connect with potential roommates that most closely align with their personal preferences/interests. Users can swipe through different profiles on the app and view information about potential roommates. Based on the information they see, they can decide to "match" and contact them about becoming roommates. Additionally, users will be given suggestions on roommates which will help them find a match more easily. These suggestions will be based on the information users give the app when creating their profiles.

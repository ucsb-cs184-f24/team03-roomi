# User Story 1

- As a user, when I find a potential roommate that I like, I can tap on their card to view their profile. On this profile is a message icon that, when pressed, will take me to a screen that will allow me to chat and have conversations with this person.

- As a user, there is a rating system so that I can see how good of a roommate people are.

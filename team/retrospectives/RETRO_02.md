* a measurement: Merging PRs will have no roadblocks with regards to multiple members working on the same task or problems with testing.
* the outcome: Multiple PRs have been merged using efficient communication and quicker code reviews resulting in a seemingly smoother process.

## Retro Assessment

* The Start, Stop, Continue retro template was used to formulate a goal, change, and measurement.
* The retro went well as a lot of feedback from team members were similar. This made it easy to identify what we are doing well and what we need to change.
* I would advise getting feedback from all team members and formulating a plan based on commonalities in their responses.

# Explanation of Files/Images
- ChatUIAfterOpeningChat.png (Starting Point): This screenshot shows the old Chat UI when you first opened up a chat (it displayed the oldest messages first rather than the most recent ones).
- ChatUIAfterScrollingDown.png (Starting Point): This screenshot just shows the rest of the old Chat UI when you scrolled down to see the most recent messages.
- mostrecentmessages.gif: This gif shows off the first two improvements I made to the Chat UI. The first one was making it to where the most recent messages are displayed first when opening up a chat. The second one was making it to where when a new message is sent, the app automatically scrolls down to the bottom of the page to show the new message that was just sent.
- chatUIexample1.png: This screenshot shows what the new Chat UI looks like right after you open up a chat.
- chatUIexample2.png: This screenshot shows what the new Chat UI looks like when you scroll all the way up to the top of the chat.

# Specific Improvements/Changes I Made from the Starting Point:
- Made it to where the most recent messages are displayed first when opening a chat
- Made it to where the app automatically scrolls down to the bottom of the chat when a new message is sent in order to display/notify of the new message
- Modified the colors/theme of the Chat UI to match with the rest of the app
- Added visible timestamps to messages to show when they were sent
- Added the name of the person the user is messaging at the top of the page

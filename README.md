# Roomi
Roomi is a mobile application that allows users to find and connect with potential roommates that most closely align with their personal preferences/interests. On the app, users will be able to swipe through different profiles and view information about potential roommates. Based on the information they see, they can decide to "match" and get in touch with them about becoming roommates. Additionally, users will be given suggestions on roommates which will help them find a match easier. These suggestions will be based on the information users give the app when creating their profiles. And this will be used to suggest matches based on similar preferences/interests/lifestyles.

## Tech Stack
- Platform: iOS
- Languages: Swift
- Backend: Firebase (for real-time database and user authentication)


## User Roles and Permissions
There are two types of users:

### Users:
- look for a potential roommate and a place to stay, or a user who already has a place to stay but is looking for a roommate to help fill it.

### Admins:
- Have all user capabilities.
- monitor and manages the app from inappropriate content, scams, etc.

We want our app to be available to a wide array of people to ensure we can maximize the amount of people we can help find roommates. Therefore, currently, we have decided not to restrict our user base to a specific domain.

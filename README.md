# Tech Stack
Our app will be developed on the iOS platform. Specifically, we have decided to use Swift/SwiftUI for the frontend and Firebase for the backend.

On the app, users will be able to swipe through different profiles and view information about potential roommates. Based on the information they see, they can decide to "match" and get in touch with them about becoming roommates. Additionally, users will be given suggestions on roommates which will help them find a match easier. These suggestions will be based on the information users give the app when creating their profiles. And this will be used to suggest matches based on similar preferences/interests/lifestyles.

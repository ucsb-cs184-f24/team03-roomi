# Alec Morrison HW4

## Starting point

My starting point exists in the HW4 folder which has one image for the list view and one video for the swipe cards implementation.
this was the starting point for the AB test for matching, but since I pivoted, I provided an image of the starting point for the
profile creation, which is an image named profile_creation_1 in the alecmorrison folder.



## Results

- New peofile creation pipeline video exists in file named profile_creation_2 in the alecmorrison folder.

### list view vs swipe view, 
- Andrew (My roommate) chose the swipe view for the novelty and ease of use
- Ryan (my other roommate) also chose the swipe view because he enjoyed the simplicity.

### one page profile creation or pipeline
- Andrew chose the pipeline because it was simpler and easier to follow (focusing on one thing at a time)
- Ryan also chose the pipeline, because it looks more professional


## Conslusion

My results pointed us to an easy decision to use the swipe cards and the multi page profile creation. We need to continue working on the profile cards to make a good profile UI including photos. We will use the new profile creation and finish implementing the photo uploads to round off all the Authentication features.
